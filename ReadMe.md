### What is Electron?

Electron is a framework that allows developers to create desktop apps using web technologies. “If you can build a website, you can build a desktop app,” is the tagline.

Under the hood, Electron is powered by the Chromium rendering engine and Node.js. Chromium is the open-source part of Google’s Chrome browser. And Node.js is powered by V8, which is Chrome’s JavaScript engine.

Electron is Chromium and Node combined into one runtime, which you control by interacting primarily with two processes: the main / browser process, and the renderer process. The main process bootstraps the app and coordinates other processes in the background, while the renderer process is responsible for what the user sees and interacts with
